# TA Guide
This is a guide for all CS10 TAs/Head TAs!

## Pre-Semester Prep
### Course Website
Here are some tasks you'll need to do before starting on the website:
* Figure out the course calendar. Be sure to run this by the professor before adding it to the website
* Update the syllabus.

Below are the tasks you'll need to do to create the new semester's course website:
* Make a new website repo in the cs10 org on Github. Create a new, blank, private repository on Github titled with the semester and year (ex: su19) and then mirror push from the previous semester's repository.
* In `bjc-r/course`, create a new lab page for the semester (like [this](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/course/cs10_fa18.html)). You can just copy a previous semesterâ€™s and update the order of the labs for this. Be sure to name it consistently with the ones from previous semesters!
* To get the labs, discussions, and lectures on the weekly schedule, go to the appropriate Google Calendars and add the sections. They will automatically populate the weekly schedule. If you do not have access to these, ping a previous Head TA.
* To automatically route to the new semester, update [this file](https://github.com/cs10/cs10.github.io/blob/master/index.html)

### New Staff Emails
To give new TAs cs10 emails, go to the CS10 Google Domain and under emails, add the new email aliases. Sometimes, the email aliases don't work with Berkeley emails, so you can route them to personal Gmail accounts instead. You do need special permissions to access the Google Domain, so talk to a previous Head TA if you need it.

### Keycard Access
Students get keycard access to the lab automatically, but we need to ask explicitly for keycard access for TAs, Readers, and Academic Interns. 

In order to get keycard access, email [Kevin Mullally](mailto:kevinm@berkeley.edu) with names, SIDs, and proxies (the first set of digits on the back of student IDs) for everyone needing keycard access. **This should be done at least a week before the semester starts, since UCPD only processes requests every Thursday.**

### Pre-Semester Meeting
Be sure to schedule a pre-semester meeting with the staff. This is usually done a couple days before the semester starts. Here are some things usually covered:
* Changes to syllabus/course policies
* TA/Reader responsibilities
* How to book rooms
* TA Homework assignment responsibilities
* How to write reading quizzes

### Academic Intern Set Up
Before doing any of the following, please go through the interest form and make sure that everyone who filled it out received at least a B- in CS10. Students who did not get at least a B- are not elligible to serve as an academic intern. 

#### Syllabus
Edit the Academic Intern syllabus with information about: 
* Units/Responsibilities
* Meetings/Make Ups
* Checkoff instructions
* Contact information
* Extra opportunities

#### Units
During the normal semester, 1-unit Academic Interns are required to work 3 hours/week and 2-unit Academic Interns are required to work 6 hours/week. In the summer, those values are doubled.

#### Contract
Once you've updated the Academic Intern syllabus, email all eligible Lab Assistant candidates with a contract form, asking for the following information: 
* How many units they'd like
* Their availability
* Some confirmation that they've read the syllabus (in the past, we've included a secret word on the syllabus that they need to fill out)
* Their ID number/proxy

In the same email, you should also send out the [Academic Intern guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LNuCs9S1jfghuKfYeFGz8mDVZmfoucWSMl-k7jRPlJ4/edit?usp=sharing) to serve as a guide for Academic Interning.

#### Piazza/Checkoff Room
Once interested students have filled out the Academic Intern contract, you may add them to an Academic Intern Piazza and to the LA Checkoff Room on Slack. You can only do the latter if you have Admin access on Slack, so be sure to ask a previous Head TA to give it to you if you don't have it!

#### Scheduling
You may use the script `scripts/AIAssigner.py` to assign sections to Lab Assistants. Instructions on usage are on the script.

#### Pre-Semester Meeting and Bonding
Schedule a pre-semester Academic Intern meeting and a separate bonding section (booking the Woz is best for bonding). 

During the pre-semester meeting, things you may go over include:
* Rules/logisitcs
* Tips from the AI Guide
* General teaching/debugging strategies

The professor usually leads bonding, so make sure they're free for it!

### Section Scheduling
After getting staff availability, we've usually assigned sections by hand. If you have enough staff to, try to pair new TAs with veteran TAs for lab sections. You may also try using the script `scripts/AIAssigner.py` and adapt it to this purpose.
